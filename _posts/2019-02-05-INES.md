# Registration

To get an idea about how many people will be coming, we kindly ask you to register [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfXqBkzOGWvK6kuLUlDMJ2viFBCwEUSfOWjpyXHohSL8ncnsA/viewform).

For the first INES hackathon, we have chosen to work on four topics.

<ul>
<li><a href="#topic-1">Topic-1:documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="#topic-2">Topic-2: norESM code structure</a></li>
<li><a href="#topic-3">Topic-3: norESM input data</a></li>
<li><a href="#topic-4">Topic-4: norESM model outputs</a></li>
</ul>

## Topic-1: documentation

#### Mentor: Michael (Oslo)

#### Goal:

This group will work on the norESM documentation. The main objective is to update the norESM documentation to help:

- new users to get the code and run norESM supported configurations
- developers to understand on how to contribute to norESM code developments
- anyone to contribute to the norESM documentation
	
#### Tasks:
- Start from https://noresm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

##### Prepare noresm github repository

- Rename NorESM documentation github repository from [https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM-docs](https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM-docs) to [https://github.com/NorESMhub/noresm](https://github.com/NorESMhub/noresm/)
- Clone the repository (from now you will be working locally)
- Create a new folder `doc` and move all the documentation to `doc`
- Push your change to github

##### Restructure norESM documentation

- Create a new branch
- Restructure NorESM code documentation and add information when missing
- Explain “Pull request” organisation procedure, who, when
- Generate the documentation locally

##### Push your changes on github 

- Push your changes on github and make a pull request

#### Expected outcome:

- Restructured documentation for noresm 2.5 in [https://github.com/NorESMhub/noresm/doc](https://github.com/NorESMhub/noresm/doc) fully tested locally and ready to be deployed.

#### Who do we need in this group

- Anyone willing to run norESM or having an experience on how to run norESM.
- Documentation is written in plain English.

#### Technical information

- [markdown cheatcheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- [RST cheatcheet](https://github.com/ralsina/rst-cheatsheet/blob/master/rst-cheatsheet.rst)
- [How do we get started on writing Sphinx documentation in RST?](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/04-sphinx/)
- [How to deploy Sphinx documentation to Read the Docs?](https://coderefinery.github.io/documentation/05-rtd/)

<h2 id="topic-2"></h2>
## Topic-2: norESM code structure

#### Mentors: Mats (Bergen), Anne (Oslo)

#### Goal:

The current [norESM code](https://github.com/metno/noresm-dev) does not follow CESM structure:
- we have two private repositories [noresm](https://github.com/metno/noresm) and [noresm-dev](https://github.com/metno/noresm-dev) hosted on github in metno github organization.
- we gave all the components (including cime coupler) in the noresm repository

So the goal of this group is to use [https://github.com/NorESMHub/noresm](https://github.com/NorESMHub/noresm) and follow CESM code structure (along with documentation, link components through manage externals).

#### Tasks:

- Github procedure and guidelines for NorESM development
- “Replace” of current noresm-dev 
- Improve competence on github usage
- Provide model structure for NorESM2.5 development
- CMIP6 version on github bitidentical to NorESM-dev but w new structure
- All forked and component githubs on NorESMhub (like ESCOMP)
- Use new NorESM github to  manage externals  
- Work per component, identify github repositories: BLOM+iHAMOCC, fork CAM6+AER, fork CTSM, CIME, MOSART, CICE, CISM
- Identify which noresm-dev code part goes into which github
- Include DCPP, data assimilation considerations
- Fork, branch and pull request handled in Norway, feedback to NCAR as it fits
- Inform NCAR about fork of model components

#### Expected outcome:

- Get a running (though probably incomplete) NorESM2 based on externals

#### Who do we need in the group

- representant of each component (ocean, atmosphere, land, etc.)
- norESM model developers
- git expertise

#### Technical information

- [Introduction to version control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/)
- [Collaborative distributed version control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/)
- [https://coderefinery.github.io/git-branch-design/](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-branch-design/)

<h2 id="topic-3"></h2>
## Topic-3: norESM input data

#### Mentor: Jan

#### Goal:

To be able to run a norESM case on another machine, one needs to have the corresponding norESM inputs. The goal of this group is to make sure anyone can get norESM inputs on any machines for runnin all the norESM supported configurations.

#### Tasks:

- Run NorESM on another machine, know what is needed as input, 
- Make data available to the outside
- Version control (via scripts in a github to pull in new NorESM github)
- Merge with CESM specific input


#### Expected outcome:

- Thredds or ftp server on nird containing basic input files not from CESM
- Updated scripts for running the model from fram, vilje and eg UiO machine

#### Who do we need in this group

We put a list of desirable expertise (you need to have at least one of them!):

- experience in running norESM
- knowledge of a scripting language (bash and/or python)

Access to virtual machines will be provided for testing.

<h2 id="topic-4"></h2>
## Topic-4: norESM model outputs

#### Mentor: Yanchun

#### Goal:

The goal is to review all the procedure for publishing norESM model outputs (cmorisation, policy for deleting experiments, archiving and long-term preservation).


#### Tasks:

- Use of cmorisation outside
- Clean up of storage system and organise 
- Experiments we do not need any more (delete or archive)
- Procedure examples for how to clean up, list your exp, size, age, touched or not, policy for users who do not work, save TB and CO2 NS2345K (1.7PB) => guideline => into documentation (with or without blaming)
- Use on any run, make it easy to do after a NorESM run
- Postprocessing infrastructure on nird (, data archive/save, jupyterhub)
- CMIP6 archive and scripts

#### Expected outcome:

- Revisited cmorisation script, documentation
- Clean up procedure with script to find data per user
- Procedure for saving and documenting model experiments
- Overview of data which could be 

#### Who do we need in this group

- users running norESM experiments
- users analyzing their norESM model outputs
- data management experts
- cmorisation experts
